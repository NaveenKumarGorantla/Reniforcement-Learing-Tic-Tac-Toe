# Reniforcement-Learing-Tic-Tac-Toe

This project is about developing a smart Reinforcement Learning agent to play Tic Tac Toe game. 

### Reniforcement learning agent is trained with four different approaches.

RL agent is trained with dynamic programming using the min max functionality wich uses the best reward action.
Rl Agent is trained on Q Learning. SARSA Learnig, SARSA Lambda Learning.
RL agent is trained using Monte carlo learning approach where the state function values are updated at the end of episode. 
RL agent chooses the best action possible in different positions on the Tic Tac Toe Board.
